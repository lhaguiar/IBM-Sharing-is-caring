    "\n",
    "In SQL you can use the percentage sign to substitute other characters.\n",

    "e.g.: If you only know that the name of the author starts with an R, you can use the following code to look up the names that match authors whose name begins with R:\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM books\n",
    "        WHERE name LIKE 'R%'\n",
    "    ;\n",
    "    i.e.: all the rows that have an author whose name begins with an R are returned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## BETWEEN predicate for Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the following code to look for all the books that where written between the year 2000 and 2010:\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM books \n",
